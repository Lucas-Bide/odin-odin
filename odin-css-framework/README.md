This is a CSS framework made for an [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html-and-css/lessons/design-your-own-grid-based-framework#null). 

It consists of a 12-column grid with padding and margin capabilites similar to Bootstrap. The rest of the framework replicates the style of the Odin Project website, with elements styled to that end.

The reset sheet is Eric Meyer's.

The Norse font was included to style the Odin Project logo.
